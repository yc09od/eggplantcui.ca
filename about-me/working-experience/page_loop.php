                        <dd>This project is implement of a Crowed funding system which base on website and server. It is challenging, since crowed funding
                            is new business; there is no too many mature business frame for it. Entrepreneurs will use this website to post their project or company
                            to collect investment; all person who register can invest projects or company posted by entrepreneurs. The website will match those two parties
                            together as business. To complete each investment, a investor will transfer money to CWIT's bank account and upload its receipt. When a project
                            get its minimum(target) investment. The project will treat as rising successfully. CWIT will transfer its investment amount from its bank account
                            to project owner. After that, the entrepreneur will send legal documents (shares,bound....)to investors.
